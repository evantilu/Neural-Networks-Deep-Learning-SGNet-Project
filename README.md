# Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning-SGNet-Project
- Implemented SGNet architechture for super-class &amp; sub-class classification on ultra low resolution images
- A variety of methods were experimented and used throughout the project
- Read the project [paper](Image Classification On Super And Sub Classes With Unseen Classes.pdf) for more detail
- Note that due to space issue, some files are not uploaded to this repo, e.g., saved_models, actual images, etc.
