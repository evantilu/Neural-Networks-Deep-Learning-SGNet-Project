# Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning-SGNet-Project
- Implemented SGNet architechture for super-class &amp; sub-class classification on ultra low resolution images
- A variety of methods were experimented and used throughout the project
- Read the project [paper](https://github.com/evantilu/Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning-SGNet-Project/blob/e7719e794bcc83c2f34a9d0e0d34b5a69e625c4d/Image%20Classification%20On%20Super%20And%20Sub%20Classes%20With%20Unseen%20Classes.pdf) for more detail
- Note that due to space issue, some files are not uploaded to this repo, e.g., saved_models, actual images, etc.
